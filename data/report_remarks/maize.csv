Cases,Generic Remarks
N - Low,"The Nitrogen content of the field is lower than normal. General recommendation of  Nitrogen for maize crop is 150-160 kg/ha. Additional 20 kg/ha along with recommended nitrogen applied at 5 split intervals (50 kg/ha @ basal dose; 40 kg/ha @ 4 leaf stage of crop; 40 kg/ha @ 8 leaf stage of crop; 35 kg/ha @ flowering stage and 15 kg/ha @ grain filling stage would improve the crop's use efficiency of nitrogen, and also the yield of the crop."
N - Normal,The Nitrogen content in the field is within the normal range.
N - High,"The Nitrogen content in the field is above the normal. Maize being a heavy nitrogen feeding crop, therefore it is advised to apply the recommended dosage of crop. "
P - Low,"The phosphorus content in the field is below normal. Therefore, adding green manure residues/composted manure/Bone meal which can increase soil mineralization rates of phosphorus."
P - Normal,The amount of phosphorus in the field is within standard range.
P - High,The amount of phosphorus in the field is above normal and can be corrected by minimizing organic manures/compost such as sheep or poultry manures (limited to 1 tonne/ha) \& FYM (which can be limited to 10 tonnes/ha).
K - Low,Potassium content in the field is low and can be fixed by adding muriate of potash or sulfate of potash. It can also be corrected by organic sources such as wood ash and kelp/seaweed available in markets. 
K - Normal,The Potassium content over the field is in the normal range.
K - High,"The potassium content in the field is above normal range. This can be corrected by ploughing and loosening the soil, fully irrigate the field with proper drainage to dissolve and flush out surplus potassium before sowing. Also avoid potassium-rich fertilizers."
OC - Low,"The amount of soil organic carbon is low and can be fixed by increasing cropping intensity, which helps to improve organic matter returns to the soil, by growing high biomass crops and pastures. It can also be managed by increasing organic inputs to the soil."
OC - Normal,The amount of soil organic carbon in the field is within standard range.
OC - High,The amount of soil organic carbon in the field is above normal. This can be fixed by reducing organic inputs to the soil such as sheep or poultry manures (limited to 1 t/ha) \& FYM (which can be limited to 10 tonnes/ha).
pH - < 5.5,Strongly Acidic soil. The application of agricultural lime (CaCO3 @ 5%) neutralizes soil acidity.
pH - 5.6-6.5,"Moderately Acidic soil. Maize crop grow best in soil with pH ranging between 5.5 - 7.3. Therefore, following ridge and furrow planting method for growing maize would help in holding soil moisture and drainage in the field, also balance pH of the soil."
pH - 6.6-6.9,"Slightly Acidic soil. Maize crop grow best in soil with pH ranging between 5.5 - 7.3. Therefore, following ridge and furrow planting method for growing maize would help in holding soil moisture and drainage in the field, also balance pH of the soil."
pH - 7.0-7.3,Neutral pH. This is desirable soil pH for optimum plant growth.
pH - 7.4-8.5,Moderately Alkaline soil. This can be reduced by leaching (irrigating the field before land preparation with proper drainage) along with improving drainage in the field not leaving risk of water-logged conditions which other way deposits salts in the soil.
pH - > 8.5,"Strongly Alkaline soil. To minimize soil alkalinity, it is recommended to spray Ammonium Sulphate (1 gm/L of water) or other sulphur treatments before sowing of the crop."
